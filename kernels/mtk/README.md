## librwkv_mtk
It seems that the neuronpilot sdk from MTK is not publicly available. The only way to get it is to contact MTK directly. The sources for this lib contains confidential and proprietary code that cannot be shared. So here's only prebuilt binary.

The file `rwkv_mtk.cpp` is a reference of how the lib works. It won't compile without the neuronpilot sdk header files.
